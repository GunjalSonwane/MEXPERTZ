            <p style="color:white;">We’re Christopher and Shawn, the founders of DRIVER. What<br>
                                      makes us good friends and business partners is our passion for<br>
                                      people, creative solutions, sustainability, and electric vehicles.<br>
                                      One weekend, during a backpacking trip in the San Bernardino<br>
                                      National Forest, we discovered we could make a positive impact<br>
                                      on our planet even after we left the forest. Thus, DRIVER was<br>
                                      born. Through self-sustainable vehicles, we could prevent carbon<br> 
                                      emissions from harming the environment. With one rental<br> 
                                      company, ourgoal is to inspire the community and the world to<br>
                                      opt out of renting gas-powered vehicles and rent sustainable
                                     all-electric cars instead.<br>
